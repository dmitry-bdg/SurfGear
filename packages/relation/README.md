## About

Two-way communication channels for transferring data between different architectural layers of a Flutter application.

## Currently supported features

- Notify your app's presentation layer about every user input or UI event (button tap, focus change, gesture detection, etc.) using `Action` and implement a reaction to them;
- Write less code with *Actions* that are customized for specific use cases (scrolling, text changing, `ValueNotifier` value changing).
- React to the data state changes and redraw UI using `StreamedState` together with `StreamedStateBuilder` and its variations;
- Manage the screen state in an easy way with a special stream that handles three predefined states: data, loading, error.

## Warning

> :warning: You may run into naming collisions when using this package.

We are using `Action` class, but there is already a class with the exact same name in the Flutter SDK, which leads to naming collisions. We recommend you to use one of 2 workarounds to avoid this issue. In the near future this class will be renamed.

### Preferred solution

The preferable solution is specifying a prefix for relation library and use it for accessing Action class.

```dart
import 'package:relation/relation.dart' as r;
```

In that case it would be necessary to use your prefix to specify the right class while reffering to it.

```dart
final action = r.Action();
```

### Optional solution

Another option is hiding Action class from Flutter SDK.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart' hide Action;
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart' hide Action;
```

This solution provides you an ability to call `Action` class from `relation` library without any additional preffixes, but deprives you of the opportunity to reffer *Action* class from the SDK.

```dart
final action = Action();
```

We will resolve this collision in one of the upcoming releases.

## Usage

### Notify and react

#### Action

`Action` is a good way to notify consumers about every event coming from the UI.

Create an `Action` class instance. You can pass data with `Action`'s events, so you need to specify the concrete type of `Action` while declaring it.

```dart
final logoutAction = Action<void>();

final addItemToCartAction = Action<Item>();
```

Find the place where you're going to handle events triggered by your `Action`. Subscribe to the event stream, which you can access through the `stream` property.

```dart
logoutAction.stream.listen(
  (_) => logout()
);

addItemToCartAction.stream.listen(
  (item) => addItemToCart(item)
);
```

Now you can trigger an event through an `Action` instance from anywhere this way:

```dart
logoutAction.accept();

addItemToCartAction.accept(item);
```

Or even easier:

```dart
TextButton(
  onPressed: logoutAction,
  ...
),
```

#### StreamedState

With `StreamedState` you can notify consumers of data changes.

Create a `StreamedState` class instance. `StreamedState` constructor allows you to set the initial value that the consumer will receive as soon as it subscribes to the `StreamedState`. You need to specify the specific data type that your `StreamedState` will handle.

```dart
final userBalanceState = StreamedState<int>(0);

final itemsInCartState = StreamedState<List<Item>>();
```

You can subscribe to `StreamedState` changes in the same way as with `Action`.

```dart
userBalanceState.stream.listen(
  (balance) => showUserBalance(balance)
);
```

To notify all consumers of data changes, you can emit the actual data to the `StreamedState` via the `accept()` function.

```dart
userBalanceState.accept(100);
```

In fact, you can use `Action`s and `StreamedState`s to communicate between any objects in your application. However, we recommend using them to connect the UI and presentation layers.

### Update UI

#### StreamStateBuilder

`StreamStateBuilder` is a widget that builds itself based on the latest snapshot of interaction with a `StreamedState`. The `StreamStateBuilder`'s behavior is almost the same as the standard `StreamBuilder` with the difference that it accepts `StreamedState` instead of the usual `Stream`, thus simplifying the initial data setup.

`StreamStateBuilder` rebuilds its widget subtree each time as its associated `StreamedState` emits a new value. This is the recommended way to organize your UI layer. It can save you from multiple `setState()` function calls.

```dart
Container(
  child: StreamedStateBuilder(
    streamedState: userBalanceState,
    builder: (ctx, balance) => _buildUserBalanceWidget(balance),
  ),
)
```

### State Management

You can build state management solution for your Flutter app using all of the above components.

We recommend using **Relation** package in conjunction with [MWWM architecture](https://pub.dev/packages/mwwm).

- Use `Action`s to notify the presentation layer about all the UI events (button taps, pull-to-refresh triggers, swipes, or other gestures detections);
- Use `StreamedState`s to report any data changes to the UI layer;
- Let `StreamedStateBuilder` manage the UI state for you. It will rebuild all its child widgets right after it detects any newly emitted data in the associated `StreamedState`.

## Extra units

The **Relation** package provides you not only some basic components for common use-cases, but even more highly specialized classes for solving specific problems.

### Extra Actions

#### ScrollOffsetActon

#### TextEditingActon

#### ControllerActon

### Extra StreamedStates

#### EntityStreamedState + EntityStateBuilder

#### TextFieldStreamedState + TextFieldStateBuilder




During initialization, for StreamedState and EntityStreamedState, you can set initial values that will be displayed when the widget is initialized.
```dart
final incrementState = r.StreamedState<int>(0);
final loadDataState = r.EntityStreamedState<int>(r.EntityState(isLoading: true));
```

final incrementState = StreamedState<int>();
final reloadAction = Action();
 final loadDataState = EntityStreamedState<int>();
### Action binding

### State management
When a user performs an action, it entails a change in the state of the program.
```dart
Future increment() async {
    return incrementState.accept(incrementState.value + 1);
}

Future _load() async {
    await loadDataState.loading();
    var result = Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2),() =>DateTime.now().second,);
await loadDataState.content(await result);
}
```
- StreamedState contain any data type.
- EntityStreamedState, in addition to storing data, also contains 3 standard states
    - loading - load data 
    - error - error of load
    - data - data load success

These states can help you design your implementation of a responsive interface.

### Update UI
To listen for changes happening in StreamedState and EntityStreamedState use the EntityStateBuilder:


StreamedStateBuilder also supports receiving states _loading_, _error_ and _data_
```dart
EntityStateBuilder<int>(
streamedState: loadDataState,
child: (ctx, data) => Text('success load: $data'),
loadingChild: CircularProgressIndicator(),
errorChild: Text('sorry - error, try again'),
),
```
## Additional States
To listen for text actions use TextEditingAction
```dart
final textAction = r.TextEditingAction();
...
textAction.stream.listen((event) {
    print("typed $event");
});
...
TextField(
    controller: textAction.controller,
    onChanged: textAction,
),
```
Use TextFieldStateBuilder to update ui
```dart
TextFieldStateBuilder(
        state: testData,
        stateBuilder: (context, data) {
        return Text('test');
}),  
```
To track the scroll offset use ScrollOffsetAction
```dart
final scrollAction = r.ScrollOffsetAction();
...
scrollAction.stream.listen((event) {
      print("scroll offset $event");
});
...
TextField(
    controller: textAction.controller,
    onChanged: textAction,
),
...
SingleChildScrollView(
    controller: scrollAction.controller,
)
```
